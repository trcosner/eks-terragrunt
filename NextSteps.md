# Next Steps: Production Readiness Roadmap

## Current Infrastructure Status: 6.5/10 â†’ Target: 8.5+/10

Our EKS infrastructure has a **solid foundation** with excellent security implementations, but needs critical observability and operational components to be production-ready. Based on our [infrastructure assessment](docs/diagrams/infrastructure-status.md), here's the prioritized roadmap.

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL - Week 1: Monitoring & Observability

**Priority: HIGHEST** - This is the most critical gap blocking production readiness.

### Why This Matters
- **Zero visibility** into cluster health, application performance, and resource utilization
- **No alerting** for critical issues like pod failures, resource exhaustion, or security breaches
- **Impossible to troubleshoot** production issues without proper monitoring
- **Required for SLA compliance** and operational excellence

### Implementation Plan
1. **Deploy Prometheus Stack**
   ```bash
   # Add to kubernetes-addons module
   cd infrastructure-modules/kubernetes-addons/
   # Create 9-monitoring.tf with kube-prometheus-stack Helm chart
   ```

2. **Configure Grafana Dashboards**
   - Kubernetes cluster overview
   - Node and pod resource utilization
   - Application performance metrics
   - Security and compliance dashboards

3. **Set Up AlertManager**
   - Critical alerts: node down, pod crash loops, resource exhaustion
   - Warning alerts: high CPU/memory usage, cert expiration
   - Integration with Slack/PagerDuty for notifications

4. **Enable First Steps with SecretProviderClass**
   ```bash
   # Enable the example SecretProviderClass now that CSI driver is installed
   cd infrastructure/dev/kubernetes-addons/
   # Set create_example_secret_provider_class = true
   terragrunt apply
   ```

### Expected Outcome
- **Real-time visibility** into cluster and application health
- **Proactive alerting** for issues before they impact users
- **Baseline for performance optimization** and capacity planning
- **Foundation for SLA monitoring** and incident response

## ðŸŸ¡ HIGH - Week 2: Centralized Logging

**Priority: HIGH** - Essential for debugging and security compliance.

### Why This Matters
- **No centralized log aggregation** makes troubleshooting extremely difficult
- **Security compliance requirements** need audit logs and monitoring
- **Application debugging** requires structured log analysis
- **Compliance and governance** need log retention and analysis

### Implementation Plan
1. **Deploy AWS CloudWatch Container Insights**
   - Enable detailed container and cluster logging
   - Set up log groups with proper retention policies

2. **Deploy Fluent Bit or AWS for Fluent Bit**
   - Configure log forwarding to CloudWatch Logs
   - Set up structured logging for applications
   - Configure log parsing and filtering

3. **Enhanced Security Logging**
   - Enable EKS audit logging
   - Configure Pod Security Standards violations logging
   - Set up network policy violation logging

### Expected Outcome
- **Centralized log management** for all cluster components
- **Searchable and analyzable logs** for troubleshooting
- **Security event monitoring** and compliance reporting
- **Improved MTTR** (Mean Time To Resolution) for issues

---

## ðŸŸ¡ HIGH - Week 3: GitOps & CI/CD Pipeline

**Priority: HIGH** - Critical for safe and reliable deployments.

### Why This Matters
- **Manual deployments are error-prone** and don't scale
- **No deployment history or rollback capability** creates risk
- **Security and compliance** require auditable deployment processes
- **Team collaboration** needs standardized deployment workflows

### Implementation Plan
1. **Deploy ArgoCD or Flux**
   - Set up GitOps operator in the cluster
   - Configure repository connections and RBAC
   - Create application definitions for workloads

2. **Create Application Deployment Templates**
   - Standardized Helm charts or Kustomize templates
   - Integration with security policies and resource limits
   - Automated testing and validation pipelines

3. **Set Up CI/CD Integration**
   - GitHub Actions or similar for build/test
   - Integration with container registry scanning
   - Automated deployment to staging â†’ production

### Expected Outcome
- **Automated, auditable deployments** with rollback capability
- **Reduced deployment errors** and faster release cycles
- **Improved security** through automated policy enforcement
- **Better team collaboration** with standardized processes

## ðŸŸ  MEDIUM - Week 4: Backup & Disaster Recovery

**Priority: MEDIUM** - Important for business continuity.

### Why This Matters
- **Data loss protection** for critical applications and configurations
- **Business continuity** requirements and RTO/RPO targets
- **Compliance requirements** often mandate backup procedures
- **Peace of mind** for production operations

### Implementation Plan
1. **Deploy Velero for Backup**
   - Set up Velero with S3 backend storage
   - Configure automated backup schedules
   - Test backup and restore procedures

2. **EKS Cluster Backup Strategy**
   - Document cluster recreation procedures
   - Automate ETCD backups (if using self-managed control plane)
   - Test cluster disaster recovery scenarios

3. **Application Data Backup**
   - Configure persistent volume backups
   - Set up database backup strategies (if applicable)
   - Document data recovery procedures

### Expected Outcome
- **Comprehensive backup coverage** for cluster and application data
- **Tested disaster recovery procedures** with documented RTOs
- **Compliance with backup requirements** and data protection
- **Reduced business risk** from data loss scenarios

## ðŸ”µ LOW - Future Enhancements (Month 2+)

### Service Mesh (Istio/Linkerd)
- **When**: After monitoring and logging are stable
- **Why**: Advanced traffic management, security, and observability
- **Effort**: 2-3 weeks implementation + learning curve

### Policy as Code (OPA Gatekeeper)
- **When**: After GitOps is established
- **Why**: Advanced policy enforcement and governance
- **Effort**: 1-2 weeks for basic policies

### Cost Optimization Tools
- **When**: After monitoring provides resource utilization data
- **Why**: Optimize resource usage and reduce AWS costs
- **Effort**: 1 week setup + ongoing optimization

### Multi-Region Setup
- **When**: Business requirements demand it
- **Why**: High availability and disaster recovery
- **Effort**: 3-4 weeks for proper multi-region architecture

## ðŸ“‹ Quick Wins (Can be done anytime)

### Enable SecretProviderClass Example
```bash
cd infrastructure/dev/kubernetes-addons/
# Edit terragrunt.hcl: create_example_secret_provider_class = true
terragrunt apply

cd ../staging/kubernetes-addons/
# Edit terragrunt.hcl: create_example_secret_provider_class = true  
terragrunt apply
```

### Deploy Example Secure Applications
```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/secure-production-app.yaml
```

5. **Configure resource quotas** and limits
6. **Establish change management processes**

### Risk Assessment
- **Without monitoring**: High risk of undetected failures
