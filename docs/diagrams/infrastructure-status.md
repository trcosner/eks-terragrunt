  NAT Gateways: $90/month (6 × $15)
  Application Load Balancers: $20/month (2 × $10)
  Route53 Hosted Zone: $0.50/month
  S3 State Storage: $5/month
  
Total Estimated: ~$350/month

Cost Optimization Opportunities:
  - Spot instances for dev environment (-40% on compute)
  - Single NAT gateway for dev (-$30/month)
  - Reserved instances for staging (-20% on compute)
  - Automated node scaling tuning (-$20/month potential)
```

#### Performance & Reliability Metrics
```yaml
Availability:
  Target SLA: 99.9% (8.76 hours downtime/year)
  Multi-AZ Deployment: ✅ Configured
  Auto-scaling: ✅ Reactive scaling in place
  Health Checks: ✅ Load balancer level only
  
Scalability:
  Current Capacity: 6-18 nodes (auto-scaling range)
  Pod Density: ~30 pods per t3.medium node
  Network Performance: Up to 5 Gbps per node
  Storage: gp3 (16,000 IOPS baseline)

Missing Performance Monitoring:
  - ❌ Response time monitoring
  - ❌ Error rate tracking  
  - ❌ Resource utilization alerts
  - ❌ Capacity planning metrics
```
